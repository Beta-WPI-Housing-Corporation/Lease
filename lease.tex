                        his license to occupancy at the Premises.  In Beta WPI’s

                performance of its obligations under this Room Deposit.  Beta
                WPI may use, apply or retain the whole or any part of the
                security deposit so deposited for the payment of any sums due

                Resident, his family, agents, employees, or social guests in
                excess of ordinary wear and tear, provided in no event shall
                Beta WPI be obligated to apply the security deposit to room
                charges or other charges in arrears or damages for failure to
                perform the terms and conditions of this Room License by

                payment as described in this Paragraph and after satisfaction of
                all of Residents obligations under this Room License shall be
                returned to Resident (with any interest earned thereon) or may
                be retained in the Beta WPI account and applied to the security
                deposit due for the next academic year.  The security deposit is
                held at\\

                                of the Meal Plan as set forth above are in
                                addition to the payments and fees set forth in

                                of said installments shall be considered a
                                default by Resident and will subject Resident to

                                license to occupancy at the Premises as provided
                                in the Room License. \textbf{In Beta WPI's
                                discretion, any payments received after thirty
                                (30) days from the due date may be assessed a

                \end{enumerate}

        \item RULES AND REGULATIONS\@: Resident acknowledges that he has been
                provided with a copy of 

        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]

                \item the By-Laws of Eta Tau Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity
                        at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (the ``Chapter''); 

                \item the House Rules of the Chapter; 

                \item the Code of Beta Theta Pi (the ``Fraternity'');

                \item the Meal Plan of the Chapter;

        \end{enumerate}

                (Document 1-5 are referred to collectively the ``Governing
                Documents''.) Beta WPI agrees to provide Resident with any
                revisions to the Governing Documents as may be enacted or
                adopted during the Term.  Resident agrees to abide by the
                Governing Documents, as well as the rules, regulations and
                policies of WPI and all applicable Federal, State, County, and
                City statutes, laws and regulations, as the same shall be duly
                enacted and/or amended, from time to time.  It is expressly
                agreed that Resident accepts said room subject to such
                enactments, rules and regulations to the same extent as if made
                a part hereof.  Violation of such rules and regulations or any
                one of them shall constitute a Total Breach of License as
                defined in Paragraph 7 at the option of Beta WPI\@.  Resident
                will not use or permit anyone else to use the Assigned Room, the
                Building, or the Premises for any unlawful purposes.  Resident
                further agrees to enforce all such rules and regulations with
                respect to his guests and will be responsible for their conduct
                at the Premises.  Any rules or regulations hereinafter made by

                incorporated by reference herein and thereafter be a part of
                this Room License.

        \item MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES\@: Resident shall keep his Assigned Room in
                the Building and its equipment and furnishings in good and clean
                condition.  At the termination of his occupancy, Resident shall
                vacate the Premises and shall leave all furniture, appliances
                and other personal property of Beta WPI in the same good
                condition in which they were received, usual wear and tear
                excepted.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to grant
                Resident the right to make repairs to the Building or other
                personal property of Beta WPI without the written consent of
                Beta WPI\@.  Resident agrees to be responsible for, and make good,
                any damage or injury done to the Premises, including damage or
                injury done to the furniture, appliances and other personal
                property of Beta WPI, by misuse or neglect by Resident, his
                guests, invites or agents and Resident agrees to pay the costs
                of any repair to the Premises or to property located in or on
                the Premises upon the presentation of a written statement by
                Beta WPI\@.  Resident will exercise reasonable care in the use of
                the Premises and will assure that no conduct by him or his
                guests damages the common areas.  The Resident agrees to pay for
                the replacement cost of all keys, door locks and bolts in the
                event his keys to the room or other areas of the Building are
                lost or stolen.  Any personal property belonging to the Resident
                remaining in the Building or on the Premises at the end of the
                Term, in the absence of a written agreement to the contrary,
                shall be deemed abandoned by the Resident and may be disposed of
                by Beta WPI at the Resident’s expense without any liability to
                Beta WPI\@. All occupants of a room may be held jointly
                responsible for any loss or damage to the room. Resident also
                shares with other residents joint responsibility for the common
                areas of the Building and may be subject to joint assessment in
                the event of loss or damage to such areas where Beta WPI
                conclude that individual responsibility cannot be established.

                Resident agrees to comply with all obligations imposed upon him
                by this Room License and by all applicable provisions of all
                Federal, State, County, and City statutes, codes, regulations
                and ordinances and, in particular: (a) to keep that part of the
                Premises which he occupies and uses clean and sanitary; (b) to
                dispose from his room all rubbish, garbage and other organic and
                flammable waste; (c) to keep all plumbing fixtures clean and
                sanitary; (d) to properly use and operate all electrical
                fixtures; (e) to prevent any person in the Building with his
                permission willfully or wantonly destroying, defacing, damaging,
                impairing or removing any part of the Building or Premises or
                the equipment or appurtenances thereto, nor himself to do any
                such thing; (f) to comply with all legal covenants and rules
                which Beta WPI can demonstrate are reasonably necessary for the
                preservation of the Premises and the property and persons of
                Beta WPI, other residents, or any other person; and (g) to
                refrain from interfering with the rights of other residents
                peacefully to enjoy the use and occupancy of the Premises.

        \item TOTAL BREACH OF LICENSE\@:  Should Resident at any time fail to pay
                the installments of room, fines, fees or other charges as
                specified herein, or should Resident violate any one of the
                agreements, terms or conditions of this Room License, then Beta
                WPI shall have the right and option to declare the Resident in
                Total Breach of this Room License.

                This Room License is made on the condition that in the event of
                Total Breach by Resident, and upon fourteen (14) days written
                notice by Beta WPI or any shorter period conferred under or by
                operation of law Beta WPI may terminate the occupancy of the
                Resident.  In such event, and in recognition that a replacement
                eligible occupant, e.g.\ an occupant who is a member of Beta WPI
                who is a student at WPI, for the room assigned to Resident may
                not be readily available, the balance of the License Fee and all
                other charges for the entire Term shall become immediately due
                and payable.  Beta WPI may at any time after a Total Breach of
                this Room License occurs, and after said written notice take
                possession of the room occupied by Resident, and may avail
                itself of any remedy provided by law for the restitution of
                possession and the recovery of any delinquent License Fees or
                charges.  In the event that Beta WPI shall find it necessary to
                expend any moneys in legally enforcing any provisions of this
                Room License, Resident agrees to be liable for such
                expenditures.

        \item PROPERTY ON PREMISES AT RESIDENT'S RISK\@: All the Resident’s
                personal property in the Building or on the Premises shall be
                and remain the sole risk of Resident.  Beta WPI shall not be
                responsible for or liable for any damages to or loss or theft of
                such personal property wherever situated for any reason
                whatsoever.  Resident shall be responsible for insuring his
                personal property and is encouraged to do so.  The insurance
                policies of Beta WPI do not cover the personal effects of the
                Resident.  Beta WPI’s providing or designation of storage space
                at the Premises or grant of permission for residents to keep
                property at the Premises (if Beta WPI should do so) whether
                during the Term or after the expiration of the Term, shall not
                be the basis of any liability or obligation of Beta WPI with
                respect to property so stored or kept.

        \item SURRENDER OF POSSESSION\@: Upon termination of this Room License
                for lapse of time, or by any breach of the Room License by the
                Resident in the performance of his agreements herein, Resident
                agrees to surrender possession of the Building and Premises to
                Beta WPI within fourteen (14) days of receipt of written notice
                from Beta WPI\@.  Termination notice shall be deemed received
                three (3) days after it was sent by United States First Class
                certified mail to the Resident at his permanent/home address as
                stated above or delivered and posted to the Resident’s room in
                the Building.  If the Resident does not timely surrender the
                room and vacate the Premises, Resident shall pay Beta WPI for
                all the damages which Beta WPI may suffer by reason thereof, and
                will indemnify Beta WPI against all claims made by any
                succeeding Resident against Beta WPI, including without
                limitation, costs of unpaid License Fees and other charges,
                costs incurred by Beta WPI resulting from any inability of Beta
                WPI to provide a room in the Building to a succeeding resident,
                so far as such delay is occasioned by failure of the Resident so
                to surrender the room his room and vacate the Building  and
                Premises.

        \item SURRENDER IN GOOD CONDITION\@: At the termination, however caused,
                of Resident’s occupancy, Resident shall surrender the room in
                the Premises in as good condition as it was in at the time
                Resident received possession thereof as determined by an
                inspection performed in witness of Beta WPI and Resident at the
                beginning of the Term, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
                Resident agrees to remove all personal possessions from the
                Premises upon such termination.  Any personal property belonging
                to the Resident remaining at the Premises at the end of the
                Term, or thirty (30) days after the earlier termination of this
                License for whatever cause, in the absence of a written
                agreement to the contrary, shall be deemed abandoned by the
                Resident and may be disposed of by Beta WPI at the Resident’s
                expense without any liability to Beta WPI\@.

                Resident agrees to pay any cost incurred by Beta WPI to repair
                or restore the room, Building, or Premises to as good condition
                as they were in at the time Resident received possession thereof
                should any damages have occurred from Resident’s occupancy.  The
                Commitment Fee, or any portion thereof, may be withheld for such
                damages or personal property removal without affecting any of
                Beta WPI’s rights regarding any other obligations of Resident
                hereunder to pay additional damages over and above any amount
                withheld from security.

        \item NO PETS\@:  Resident expressly agrees not to keep or maintain on the
                Premises any dog, cat, bird, fish, snake, or other pet, except
                with the prior written consent of Beta WPI, which consent, if
                given, may be revoked by Beta WPI at any time.  This provision
                shall not be construed to prohibit occupancy by a Resident with
                a disability who uses a Service Animal, as defined by the
                regulations promulgated under Title III of the Americans with
                Disabilities Act, as amended.

        \item MARIJUANA\@: Resident may not grow marijuana on the Premises or
                allow any other individual to grow marijuana on the Premises.

        \item LOCKS AND KEYS\@: No additional locks shall be placed upon any
                interior or exterior doors or windows of the Building without
                the prior written permission of Beta WPI\@.  If Resident obtains
                said permission and places additional locks on any doors of the
                Building, Resident agrees to furnish Beta WPI with a copy of
                each key to each such additional lock.  Resident shall surrender
                to Beta WPI all keys to the Building and rooms at the end of the
                Term.  Resident hereby agrees that any additional locks placed
                by him upon any doors or windows of the Building thereupon
                become fixtures and property of Beta WPI and shall not be
                removed by Resident without the prior written permission of Beta
                WPI\@.

        \item FIRE HAZARDS\@: Resident shall follow all rules and regulations
                regarding fire safety, any prohibition on open flames, use or
                prohibition of certain lighting fixtures, shall not alter or
                tamper with any smoke or carbon monoxide detectors, shall not
                block any areas of egress from the Building, and other fire
                safety rules, regulations, and restrictions for occupancy at the
                Premises.  Resident shall not possess any item, nor commit any
                act, nor permit to be committed any act that might create a fire
                hazard or that might cause a fire or that will increase the rate
                of or contravene any fire insurance on said Building.  If
                Resident’s use or occupancy of the Building or the Premises
                increases the premium on any fire insurance policy, Resident
                shall pay the amount of such increase.  In the event that the
                Building is damaged by fire, rain, wind, or other casualty,
                then, at the sole option of Beta WPI, the Building will be
                repaired within a reasonable time at the expense of Beta WPI,
                and Beta WPI shall never be obligated to make other than minor,
                non-structural repairs following a fire or other casualty.  In
                the event that the damage is so extensive as to render the
                Building unable to be occupied by residents, pursuant to a
                reasonable determination by Beta WPI, the room fees and charges
                shall cease until such time as the Building shall be repaired to
                a condition allowing re-occupancy.  In the event that Beta WPI
                elects not to restore the Building to allow re-occupancy after
                any fire or other casualty, the room fees and charges shall be
                paid for the period of occupancy to the time of such fire or
                casualty and thereafter this Room License shall cease and come
                to an end. Beta WPI shall not be liable for any damage,
                compensation or claim by reason of casualty, inconvenience or
                annoyance arising from any fire or casualty, the necessity of
                repairing any portion of the Building, or the termination of
                this Room License by reason of damage or destruction of the
                Building.

        \item CLOSING OF CHAPTER\@: If the Chapter is dis-established or ceases to
                be recognized as a student organization by WPI, this Room
                License shall, at the option of Beta WPI, come to an end, except
                that those obligations incurred through the date of such event
                shall remain fully due and enforceable.

        \item SERVICES\@: Beta WPI shall furnish to Resident the following
                utilities and services: water, heat, hot water, electricity,
                light, power, internet, trash removal and equipment to be used
                by residents who are occupying the Premises to maintain the
                grounds.  Beta WPI shall not be liable for any inconvenience,
                loss, or damage caused by insufficiency of heat or irregularity
                in the supply of electric current.  Residents, and not Beta WPI,
                are responsible for routine Building and grounds maintenance at
                the Premises.

                As part of the Building maintenance, Residents shall not set the
                temperature of the thermostat to less than fifty five (55)
                degrees Fahrenheit.

        \item HOLD HARMLESS\@: Resident acknowledges and agrees that, with regard
                to the use or occupancy of the Premises and the personal
                property contained therein, whether owned by another resident,
                Beta WPI or other person or entity, he is responsible and liable
                for his personal actions and those of his guests, invitees and
                agents, including, but not limited to negligent and intentional
                acts, errors or omissions or any breach of the terms of this
                Room License by any of them.  The Resident and Parent(s) hereby
                jointly and severally agree to defend, indemnify and hold
                harmless Beta WPI, the Beta WPI Chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha
                Fraternity at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Lambda Chi Alpha
                International Fraternity and each of their respective agents,
                officers, volunteers and employees for all claims, damages or
                losses (including legal expenses incurred in the defense of any
                claim) incurred by any of them and in any way connected with or
                arising out of the occupancy or use of the Building and the
                Premises by the Resident or his guests, invitees or agents.

        \item ATTORNEY'S FEES\@: In the event that legal action becomes necessary
                to enforce the terms of this License, Resident agrees to pay all
                of Beta WPI’s reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses and costs,
                which Beta WPI incurs in the event Beta WPI employs an attorney
                to enforce Beta WPI’s rights hereunder.

        \item WAIVER OF ONE BREACH NOT A GENERAL WAIVER\@: Failure of Beta WPI to
                enforce all or any portion of this License or any other Beta WPI
                or Lambda Chi Alpha regulation, bylaw or policy against the
                Resident, Parent(s or any other resident of the Building does
                not act as a waiver nor does it limit the ability of Beta WPI to
                enforce all the rights and privileges at any time under this
                License.  No waiver of any breach of the covenants, provisions
                or condition contained in this Room License shall be construed
                as a waiver of the covenant itself or of any subsequent breach
                hereof; and if any breach shall occur and afterwards be
                compromised, settled or adjusted, this Room License shall
                continue in full force and effect as if no breach had occurred.

        \item SUBLICENSE\@: Resident shall personally use and occupy the room and
                Building and shall not sublicense the room or Building or any
                part thereof, or suffer or permit the Premises or part thereof
                to be used by an additional occupant; and shall not transfer or
                assign this Room License without the prior written approval of
                Beta WPI, which approval may be provided or withheld in the sole
                discretion of Beta WPI\@.

        \item ACCESS BY BETA WPI\@: Resident agrees that Beta WPI and/or its
                agents may, and Beta WPI and its agents reserve the right to,
                enter the Resident’s room without prior notice for the purpose
                of inspecting the room and its contents to ascertain compliance
                with the terms of this Room License and all rules/laws mentioned
                in Paragraphs 5 and 6 above, to assure the safety of the
                occupants of the Premises and to make such repairs, alterations,
                additions and improvements as Beta WPI may deem necessary or
                desirable.  Beta WPI shall have the right, during the Term
                hereby created, to show the rooms and the Building to
                prospective residents.

        \item NO BROKER INVOLVED\@: Beta WPI and Resident represent to each other
                that neither has dealt with any broker, agent or finder in
                connection with this Room License or the Premises, and each
                party covenants to indemnify and hold harmless the other party
                from and against any and all costs, expense or liability
                (including reasonable attorney’s fees) to any broker, agent or
                finder who alleges that Beta WPI or Resident, as the case may
                be, dealt with such broker, agent or finder with respect to the
                Room License for the Premises or the negotiation therefore.
        
        \item JURISDICTION AND SEVERABILITY\@: This Room License shall be
                construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
                Massachusetts.  In the event any court of competent jurisdiction
                shall declare any portion of this Room License to be invalid,
                the remainder of this Room License shall not be invalidated
                thereby, but shall remain in full force and effect.  The
                Resident’s rights under this License are personal and may not be
                assigned to any other person.  The Resident and Parent(s)
                expressly agree that any action or proceeding relating to or
                arising out of this License may be brought in the courts of the
                county in which the Premises are located and consent to the
                jurisdiction of such courts.

        \item MODIFICATION\@: This License constitutes the entire agreement
                between Beta WPI and the Resident and Parent(s), and it shall
                not be amended, altered or changed except by a written agreement
                signed by the parties hereto.
        
        \item COPY OF LICENSE\@: Beta WPI shall deliver a copy of this License,
                duly executed by Beta WPI, to the Resident within thirty (30)
                days after a copy hereof, duly executed by the Resident, has
                been delivered to Beta WPI\@.

        \item OUTSTANDING BALANCE\@: The Resident shall have made payment of all
                outstanding debts/balances to Beta WPI prior to occupying space
                for the period encompassed within this License.

        \item ELIGIBILITY FOR OCCUPANCY\@: Resident understands and agrees that
                occupancy of the Premises is restricted to persons who are
                members of the Beta WPI Chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity
                at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and may be further
                restricted, at the option of Beta WPI, to individuals who are
                enrolled as students at WPI\@. If a Resident ceases to be a
                member of the Beta WPI Chapter or ceases to be an enrolled
                student at WPI, then this shall constitute a Total Breach of
                License as defined in Paragraph 8 at the option of Beta WPI\@.

        \item FORCE MAJEURE; ACTS OF NATURE\@: Beta WPI assumes no responsibility
                for failure to perform any terms or conditions of this License
                due to any force majeure including, but not limited to, fire,
                earthquake, flood, hurricane, strikes, work stoppages or other
                labor disturbances, riots or civil commotions, litigation, war
                or other act of any foreign nation, plague, epidemic, pandemic,
                power of government or governmental agency or authority, or any
                other cause like or unlike any cause mentioned above, which is
                beyond the control or authority of Beta WPI\@. If WPI closes its
                physical campus due to any force majeure, this Room License
                shall, at the option of Beta WPI, come to an end. In the case of
                termination due to force majeure, Beta WPI will refund Resident
                a prorated sum of the license fee, provided that Resident has
complied with all provisions of this Room License.  \end{enumerate}
